# Course Booking System: Filter and Hooks

The functions.php of each child theme can be used to make individual adjustments to themes and plugins using filters and hooks. On the one hand, we list all filters and hooks here and give examples of how to use them. The lists and examples are constantly being expanded.

These code examples are for the [Course Booking System](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/course-booking-system/) from [ComMotion](https://commotion.online/).
